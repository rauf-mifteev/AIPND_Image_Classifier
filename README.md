# Image Classifier Project for Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

This is image classifier project for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, I first develop code for an image classifier in **Jupiter Notebook** using **PyTorch**, then convert it into a command line **Python** application. The command line application consists of two scripts: 
* train.py - to train the model, or to be precise, to train classifier layers on top of one of two pretrained models: **VGG19** or **Alexnet** using **learning transfer**.
* predict.py - to predict an image class using model that was trained by train.py. 

## Project assets:

* Image Classifier Project.ipynb  - Jupyter Notebook.
* Image Classifier Project.html  - HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook above.
* train.py - command line application to train a new model on a data set.
* predict.py - command line application to predict flower name from an image.
