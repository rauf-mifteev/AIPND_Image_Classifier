# Image Classifier Project for Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

This is image classifier project for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, I first develop code for an image classifier in Jupiter Notebook using PyTorch, then convert it into a command line Python application. The command line application consists of two parts: one to train the model (to train classifier layers on top of pretrained model) and the second to predict an image class using previously trained network. One of two pretrained models could be used: VGG19 or Alexnet.

## Project assets:

* Image Classifier Project.ipynb  - Jupyter Notebook.
* Image Classifier Project.html  - HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook above.
* train.py - command line application to train a new model on a data set.
* predict.py - command line application to predict flower name from an image.
