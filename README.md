# Image Classifier Project for Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

## Project Overview

This is image classifier project for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, I first develop code for an image classifier in **Jupiter Notebook** using **PyTorch**, then convert it into a command line **Python** application. The command line application consists of two scripts: 
* train.py - to train the model, based on of one of the two pretrained models: **VGG19** or **Alexnet** using **learning transfer**.
* predict.py - to predict an image class using model that was trained by train.py. 

## Project assets

* Image Classifier Project.ipynb  - Jupyter Notebook.
* train.py - command line application to train a new model on a data set.
* predict.py - command line application to predict flower name from an image.

## Prerequisites

The code is **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** and it uses:

* [PyTorch](https://https://pytorch.org//)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

You can install everything you need to run this project with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## Installing
Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/rauf-mifteev/DLND_Face_Generation.git`

## Run the Code
Navigate to the cloned directories location and start jupyter notebook with dlnd_face_generation.ipynb:

`jupyter notebook dlnd_face_generation.ipynb`
